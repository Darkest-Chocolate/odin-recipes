                    <li>2 tsp dijon mustard</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
                    <li>¼ tsp smoked paprika</li>
                    <li>1 cup low sodium chicken broth</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp arrowroot flour</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
                    <li>5-7 sprigs of thyme tied into a bundle using kitchen twine</li>
                    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                    <li>1 lb yellow potatoes cut into 2-inch pieces</li> 
                </ul>
            <h3>STEPS</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
                    <li>Pat the chicken dry and season on both sides with the salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe large, deep skillet (I use the Made In 3.5 quart saute pan) over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>When hot, in batches so as to not overcrowd the skillet add the chicken, and cook until golden on each side (about 2 minutes per side) transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.</li>
                    <li>Add the dijon, tomato paste, and paprika and toss until well combined.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the broth and the arrowroot flour until well combined. Slowly pour in the broth mixture while stirring until well combined. (*Your sauce will almost immediately thicken. Don’t worry-- when the chicken cooks down, it will add additional juices to the sauce and it turns out perfectly in the end).</li>
                    <li>Remove from the heat and stir in the apple cider vinegar, add the bundle of thyme and the bay leaves. Place the chicken on top of the veggies, skin side up. Cover and transfer to the oven and bake for 40 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven, and increase the heat to 400 degrees F.</li>
                    <li>Remove the cover and carefully nestle the potatoes into the sauce, tucking them under the chicken (just be delicate moving around the chicken so the skin doesn’t fall off!). Transfer back to the oven and bake, uncovered, until the skin is a deep golden brown and crisp, the potatoes are tender, and the sauce has thickened, about 30 more minutes.</li>
                    <li>Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes prior to serving. Garnish with parsley, if desired, and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
