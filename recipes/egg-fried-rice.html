        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5-6 green onions</li>
            <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp crushed chilli flakes (add based on spice tolerance)</li>
            <li>2 servings cold rice</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>Cooking oil as needed</li>

            <li>1 tbsp light/regular soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp water</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean and trim 5-6 green onions. Mince the white parts and thinly slice the green parts for garnish</li>
            <li>Mince 6 cloves of garlic. Add more or less depending on size of the cloves or taste</li>
            <li>Take 2 servings of cold, day old rice in a bowl and separate the clumps. This helps in even stir frying. Cold, slightly dried out rice is essential for the perfect fried rice texture</li>
            <li>Mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl and set aside</li>
            <li>To a heated wok/pan add some oil and scramble 2 eggs with a pinch of salt. Set aside</li>
            <li>Set flame to medium and add 2 tbsp neutral cooking oil. When the oil is hot, sauté the garlic and green onion for 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Reduce flame to low and sauté 1-2 tbsp crushed red chilli flakes for 30 seconds or until fragrant. Chilli flakes will burn if the flame is too high</li>
            <li>Increase flame to medium high, add rice and stir fry until mixed well with the aromatics</li>
            <li>Add the prepared sauce and stir fry for 2-3 minutes. The rice needs to fry well so keep tossing and turning</li>
            <li>When the rice is fried well, add the previously scrambled eggs. Mix everything well and adjust salt if needed</li>
            <li>Add the green part of green onions and switch off the flame. You don’t want to overcook them</li>
        </ol>
